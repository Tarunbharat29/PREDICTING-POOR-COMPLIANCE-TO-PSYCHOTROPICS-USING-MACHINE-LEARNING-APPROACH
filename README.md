# Predicting Poor Compliance to Psychotropics Using Machine Learning Approach

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict poor compliance among psychiatric patients prescribed psychotropic medications. Non-compliance to such treatments can lead to relapse, hospitalization, and worsening of symptoms. By using data-driven approaches, this project helps in early identification of at-risk patients, enabling timely interventions and improved healthcare outcomes.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict patient compliance status based on clinical and demographic data.
- Identify key features contributing to non-compliance using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.
- Assist healthcare professionals in making proactive decisions to improve patient adherence.

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **ML Libraries**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn
- **Data Processing**: pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Explainable AI**: SHAP, LIME
- **IDE**: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook

## 🗂️ Dataset

- The dataset contains anonymized patient records including:
  - Demographic info (Age, Gender)
  - Clinical history
  - Medication types
  - Follow-up details
  - Compliance label (Compliant / Poor Compliance)

> Note: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.

## ⚙️ Model Building

1. **Data Preprocessing**
2. **Feature Selection**
3. **Model Training**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost
4. **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
5. **Explainability**: SHAP and LIME for model interpretation

## 📈 Results

- Best model: Random Forest with ~97% accuracy
- Key Predictors: Follow-up frequency, medication type, previous adherence patterns
- Visuals: Feature importance plots, SHAP summary and waterfall plots

## 💡 Conclusion

This ML-driven approach can serve as an early-warning system to identify patients at risk of poor medication compliance. With further clinical validation, it can support decision-making in psychiatric care settings.

## 📌 Future Work

- Incorporate time-series patient monitoring data
- Deploy the model via a user-friendly dashboard
- Collaborate with mental health institutions for real-time testing
